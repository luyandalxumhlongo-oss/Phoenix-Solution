## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
``` c
// TODO: Briefly explain the motivation behind your project.
South Africa still struggles with financial inclusion: many people remain unbanked because traditional accounts are expensive or hard to maintain, even as payments and everyday transactions move rapidly online. Thuma Mina aims to bridge this gap by offering a simple, secure, and accessible digital service for anyone with a basicÂ mobileÂ phone.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
``` c
// TODO: Mention ideas or features youâ€™d add if given more time.
Our primary next step is to integrate an SMS API, enabling Thuma Mina to function entirely through text messaging.
This enhancement will let users with any basic cellphone without smartphones or internet access register, load vouchers, check balances, and send money directly via SMS, ensuring truly nationwideÂ accessibility.
